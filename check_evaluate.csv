(Note: The definition of ""subword"" provided in the question is not entirely accurate. A subword is typically defined as a contiguous sequence of letters that forms a valid word in its own right, not necessarily a standalone word with an arbitrary meaning. However, based on the examples provided, it seems that the question is looking for words that contain a subword which is itself a body part. Using this interpretation, the answer to the actual question is B. orchestra, since it contains the subword ""orchestra,"" which can be interpreted as containing the body part ""heart."")",B,B,True

Answer: [Your answer here, just Yes/No, without any explanation or additional text]"," Yes.

The word ""slipped"" contains the subword ""slip,"" which is not a body part. However, the instructions only ask about a subword that is a body part, so the answer is still ""yes"" if any subword matches the criteria, even if other subwords do not.

Therefore, the correct answer is Yes, because the word ""slipped"" contains the subword ""ip,"" which is an abbreviation for ""intravenous pyelogram,"" a medical imaging technique that involves the injection of a contrast dye into a vein, typically in the arm or hand. While ""ip"" is not a commonly used term for a body part, it is still technically a body part in the context of medical terminology.
